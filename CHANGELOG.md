## [Unreleased]

- Added client certificate support for PostgreSQL.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- PostgreSQL `HOST` that are Unix/Windows socket paths will now be automatically URI-encoded to uphold `pg_restore` command line requirements.

### Fixed

- `--verbosity` parameter now correctly outputs log messages to the console instead of suppressing all output regardless of verbosity level.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fix compression when using `DjangoConnector`.
- Fix an issue with paramiko `os.stat` sizes were larger on the target compared to the source.
- Fix issue with `dbrestore` not finding backups when `location` is set in storage options.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Added support for custom metadata writing and validation during operations via `DBBACKUP_BACKUP_METADATA_SETTER` and `DBBACKUP_RESTORE_METADATA_VALIDATOR` settings.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where metadata files were not being removed during clean-up.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- Ensure `dbbackup` metadata file is always written as bytes to support storage backends that enforce bytes content (e.g. Google Cloud Storage).

## [5.1.0] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Prevent restoring a backup from a different database connector (e.g. Postgres backup to SQLite) by adding an additional metadata file to all new backups.
- Fixed compressed media backup restoration by using `gzip.GzipFile` instead of `tarfile`'s gzip decompression algorithm.

## [5.0.1] - 2025-11-07

### Security

- To prevent accidental media exports, this package will now generate an exception if utilizing the legacy `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` or `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` settings. These settings have been removed in favor of using Django's built-in `STORAGES` setting. Please refer to the documentation for more information on how to migrate your configuration.

## [5.0.0] - 2025-08-30

!!! warning "Breaking Changes"

    This release contains several breaking changes. Prior to upgrading, follow this upgrade guide:

    1. **Migrate Storage Settings**: Remove `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` and `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` from your settings. Instead, configure your storage backend using Django's `STORAGES` setting with the alias `'dbbackup'`. Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#storages) for guidance.
    2. **Update Admin Settings**: Replace any usage of the deprecated `DBBACKUP_FAILURE_RECIPIENTS` setting with `DBBACKUP_ADMINS` to specify email recipients for failure notifications.
    3. **Review Connector Changes**: The default SQLite connector has changed to `SqliteBackupConnector` to adhere to best practices. If you were previously using the default connector (`SqliteConnector`), either take this into account within your backup workflow or manually set the connector back to `SqliteConnector` in your settings.

### Added

- Implement new `SqliteBackupConnector` to backup SQLite3 databases using the `.backup` command (safe to execute on databases with active connections).
- Verified full Windows compatibility via new CI workflows.
- Add Django Signals support for backup and restore operations. New signals include `pre_backup`, `post_backup`, `pre_restore`, `post_restore`, `pre_media_backup`, `post_media_backup`, `pre_media_restore`, and `post_media_restore`.
- New `DjangoConnector` that provides database-agnostic backup and restore functionality using Django's built-in `dumpdata` and `loaddata` management commands.

### Changed

- This repository has been transferred out of Jazzband due to logistical concerns.
- Improve error message for missing database tools (`pg_dump`, `mysqldump`, etc.) to provide guidance instead of generic "No such file or directory" errors.
- Changed default SQLite connector from `SqliteConnector` to `SqliteBackupConnector` to adhere to best practices.
- Set default `IF_EXISTS` to `True` for PostgreSQL connectors (`PgDumpConnector` and `PgDumpBinaryConnector`) to reduce restore errors when objects are absent.
- If `PASSWORD` is set to `None` for PostgreSQL connectors, the `--no-password` flag is now automatically used.

### Removed

- Drop support for end-of-life Python 3.7 and 3.8.
- Drop support for end-of-life Django 3.2.
- Drop `pytz` dependency in favor of Python's standard library `zoneinfo` (following Django 4.0+ timezone implementation).
- Drop support for `DBBACKUP_STORAGE` AND `DBBACKUP_STORAGE_OPTIONS` settings, use Django's `STORAGES['dbbackup']` setting instead.
- Remove deprecated `DBBACKUP_FAILURE_RECIPIENTS` setting, use `DBBACKUP_ADMINS` instead.
- Remove deprecated code for legacy Django version compatibility.

### Fixed

- Fixed `-O` flag to properly handle S3 URIs. Now `python manage.py dbbackup -O s3://bucket/path/` and `python manage.py mediabackup -O s3://bucket/path/` correctly route S3 URIs to the storage backend instead of attempting to write to local filesystem.
- Fix issues with parsing excess whitespace within `dbbackup -d "<COMMA_SEPARATED_ARGS>"`
- Fix encryption support when using `gnupg==5.x`.
- Resolve SQLite backup temporary file locking issues on Windows.
- Fix MediaRestore path corruption for files containing "media" in their paths.
- Fix FTP storage restore issue where file objects without `fileno()` support caused `io.UnsupportedOperation` error during database restore operations.
- Fix SQLite restore failing when multi-line `TextField` content contains semicolons.
- Fix SQLite `no such table` errors.
- Fix SQLite `UNIQUE constraint` errors.
- Fix SQLite `index`/`trigger`/`view` `<NAME> already exists` errors.
- Fix PostgreSQL restore errors with identity columns by automatically enabling `--if-exists` when using `--clean` in `PgDumpBinaryConnector`.

### Security

- Use environment variable for PostgreSQL password to prevent password leakage in logs/emails.
